# Implementation_of_DS_Library
Technology used :-
  C++ programming
Description:-
1)This Project is Considered as a library which contains generic implementations of all major types of data structures.
2)We provide the readymade implementation of all fundamental operations as well as advanced operation on linear, non linear data structures in an object oriented way.
3)We provide the genetic way of implementations so we can use the functionality for any type of data structures.
4)All object oriented Policies are used in this project.
